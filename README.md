# Waveforms
Create 3 types of waveforms: Sawtooth, Square, Triangle.
Have those waves output a point on a y-axis -1 to 1
X-axis is in MICROSECONDS and each period of each wave is 1 second or 1,000,000 MICROSECONDS
Takes plotted points and creates .wav files for each at 440hz
MyForm.eps displays the graphs for each waveform
