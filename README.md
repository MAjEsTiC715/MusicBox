# Waveforms
1.) Create 3 types of waveforms: Sawtooth, Square, Triangle

2.) Have those waves output a point on a y-axis -1 to 1

3.) X-axis is in MICROSECONDS and each period of each wave is 1 second or 1,000,000 MICROSECONDS

4.) Takes plotted points and creates .wav files for each at 440hz

5.) MyForm.eps displays the graphs for each waveform
